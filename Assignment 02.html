    <p>
        <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was a prominent Indian revolutionary and freedom fighter who played a key role in the struggle for India’s independence from British rule. Born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan), he became a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression.</p>

<p>Bhagat Singh is best known for his involvement in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and his radical approach to achieving independence. He was deeply influenced by the writings and ideologies of Marxism and was committed to the idea of a socialist revolution in India.</p>

<p>One of his most notable actions was the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in 1929, along with Batukeshwar Dutt. The intent was to protest against repressive laws and to make a political statement. They were arrested and used their trial as a platform to propagate their ideas of revolution and independence.</p>


<p>Bhagat Singh was also involved in the killing of British police officer John Saunders in 1928, which he and his associates carried out in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, who had succumbed to injuries inflicted by the police during a protest.</p>

<p>His trial and subsequent execution on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23, turned him into a martyr and a national hero. Bhagat Singh’s courage, revolutionary zeal, and his ultimate sacrifice continue to inspire many in India and beyond, symbolizing the struggle for justice and freedom.
